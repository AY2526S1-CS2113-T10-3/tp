# Cheng Lefan - Project Portfolio Page
## Overview
Our project is a comprehensive academic management system designed to help university students track and manage their course information, grades, and academic performance. The application provides features such as grade tracking, GPA calculation, course reviews, and performance analytics. It aims to centralize all academic-related information in one convenient platform, enabling students to make informed decisions about their academic journey and monitor their progress effectively.

### Enhancements Implemented
#### 1. Course Search and Filtering Feature (Issue #11)
- What it does: Allows users to search and filter courses based on various criteria such as course code, name, or other attributes. 
- Justification: This enhancement is essential for users managing multiple courses across semesters. It significantly improves user experience by enabling quick access to specific course information without having to scroll through the entire course list. 
- Highlights: The implementation required careful consideration of search algorithms and filtering logic to ensure efficient and accurate results. I designed the feature to be extensible, allowing for future enhancements such as advanced filtering options.
#### 2. Review Management System
- Review Post Feature: Implemented the functionality for users to create and post reviews for their courses, allowing students to share their experiences and insights. 
- Review Edit Feature: Developed the editing capability that enables users to modify their previously posted reviews, ensuring review information remains current and accurate. 
- Review Delete Feature: Created the deletion functionality to allow users to remove reviews they no longer wish to keep. 
- Justification: The review system adds significant value to the application by creating a knowledge-sharing platform where students can help each other make informed course selections. This peer-to-peer information exchange is crucial for academic planning. 
- Highlights: The implementation required careful design of the data structure to efficiently store and retrieve reviews. I ensured data integrity by implementing proper validation and error handling mechanisms.
#### 3. Testing and Code Quality Enhancements
- JUnit Test Cases: Added comprehensive JUnit test cases to ensure feature reliability and robustness across the application, improving overall code coverage and quality. 
- Assertions Implementation: Enhanced code reliability by implementing assertions throughout the codebase to catch potential bugs and validate program state during development and runtime. 
- Justification: These enhancements are critical for maintaining code quality and preventing bugs. Comprehensive testing ensures that features work as intended and continue to function correctly as the codebase evolves. 
- Highlights: The test cases cover various edge cases and scenarios, ensuring robust error handling and validation. The assertions help catch bugs early in the development process.

### Contributions to the User Guide
- Documentation/user guide update-1: Contributed comprehensive documentation for the search and filtering features, as well as the complete review management system (post, edit, delete).
- Wrote clear, user-friendly instructions with examples to help users understand how to effectively use these features. 
- Included common use cases and troubleshooting tips to enhance user experience.

### Contributions to the Developer Guide
- Documentation/diagrams setup: Set up the initial structure and framework for technical diagrams in the Developer Guide. 
- Documentation/developer guide setup: Established the overall structure and sections of the Developer Guide to ensure consistency and completeness. 
- Documentation/embed diagrams in developer guide: Integrated UML diagrams and other technical diagrams into the Developer Guide to illustrate system architecture and component interactions. 
- Created detailed technical documentation explaining the implementation of the search/filter feature and the review management system. 
- Designed and updated UML diagrams to visualize the architecture and workflow of my implemented features. 

### Contributions to Team-Based Tasks
- Actively participated in team meetings and discussions regarding project direction and feature prioritization. 
- Helped establish documentation standards and structure for both User Guide and Developer Guide. 
- Contributed to project planning and timeline management. 
- Assisted in organizing the AboutUs.md page and ensuring all team member information was properly documented.

### Review/Mentoring Contributions
- Reviewed and provided feedback on pull requests from team members. 
- Collaborated with teammates to resolve merge conflicts and integration issues. 
- Shared knowledge about documentation best practices with the team.

Note: This PPP demonstrates my contributions across multiple aspects of the project, including feature development, documentation, testing, and team collaboration. The enhancements I implemented are non-trivial, requiring careful design consideration, robust implementation, and comprehensive testing to ensure they integrate seamlessly with the existing system.
